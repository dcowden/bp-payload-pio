High Priority
* why does the other side read 500 when saturated?
* weird runaway situation? happens when you just barely catch the corner?
* better connector on wire loop
* motor slow start
* caps at adc

Next Features
* use interediate checkpoint
* proximity detection for checkpoint-- add time

Low priority
* add logging library
* move eeprom code into separate file
* set times in ft/sec not rpm
  --@6000,  20.5 revs/30s = 41 rpm . 6 in wheel -> 64fpm at 6000
  -->  6000    64 fpm 1 fps
  -->  3000    32 fpm 0.5 fps
  -->  1500    16 fpm 0.25 fps
* fix missing small curves
   --- possible algo. if no sensor readings and you had a 4000 in the last xx,
     then you missed the wire, turn towards the sensor
* move game over result code into game

DONE
* Higher max speed
* open up speed options
* refactor icky eeprom write code
* add speed settings into eeprom
* move all pin definitions into one file
* red button should stop progress
* Misses small curves
* advancing non-stop should be overtime
* odd delay after game over ?????
* proximity detection for end


BOARD VERSION 2 notes
* 0.1uf caps for adc pins
* move i2c ports for usb conflict
* make footprint right ( or, use different esp model)
* usb footprings were not right
* ultrsonic sensor port/pins
